<div class="level1">

<p>
This (incomplete) page describes some syntax and commands considered obsolete by some measure. A thorough discussion of the rationale is beyond the scope of this page. See the <a href="/scripting/nonportable" class="wikilink1" title="scripting:nonportable"> portability page</a> for a discussion on portability issues.
</p>

<p>
This first table lists syntax that is tolerated by Bash but has few if any legitimate uses. These features exist mostly for Bourne, csh, or some other backward compatibility with obsolete shells, or were Bash-specific features considered failed experiments and deprecated or replaced with a better alternative. These should be irrelevant to most everyone except maybe code golfers. New scripts should never use them. None of the items on this list are specified by the most current version of POSIX, and some may be incompatible with POSIX.

Shells without this feature treat <code>cmd1 &amp;&gt;file cmd2</code> as: &quot;background <code>cmd1</code> and then execute <code>cmd2</code> with its stdout redirected to <code>file</code>&quot;, which is the correct interpretation of this expression.

Most of the important expansions are performed at the same time from left to right. However, a few expansions, most notably word-splitting and globbing, and in shells other than Bash, <a href="/syntax/expansion/brace" class="wikilink1" title="syntax:expansion:brace"> brace expansion</a>, are performed <strong>on the results of previous expansions, by default, unless they are quoted.</strong> This means that the act of expanding an unquoted variable in an ordinary argument context, depending on the value of the variable, can yield different results depending on possibly uncontrolled side-effects like the value of <code>IFS</code>, and the names of files in the current working directory. You can&#039;t get globbing without word-splitting, or vice versa (without <code>set -f</code>). <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/050" class="urlextern" title="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/050" rel="nofollow"> You can&#039;t store a command or character-delimited list in a variable and safely evaluate it with unquoted expansion</a>. If possible, always choose a shell that supports Korn shell arrays such as Bash. They are a vital but non-standard feature for writing clean, safe scripts. Well-written scripts don&#039;t use word-splitting. A few exceptions are listed on the <a href="/syntax/expansion/wordsplit" class="wikilink1" title="syntax:expansion:wordsplit"> word splitting page</a>.

New-style command substitutions are widely implemented by every modern shell (and then some). The only reason for using backticks is for compatibility with a real Bourne shell (like Heirloom). Backtick command substitutions require special escaping when nested, and examples found in the wild are improperly quoted more often than not.

The expressions consist of regular arguments, unlike the Ksh/Bash <code>[[</code> command. While the issue is analogous to <code>let</code> vs <code>((</code>, the advantages of <code>[[</code> vs <code>[</code> are even more important because the arguments/expansions aren&#039;t just concatenated into one expression.

and the <code>ERR</code> trap  </td><td class="col1 leftalign">proper control flow and error handling  </td><td class="col2"><code>set -e</code> causes untested non-zero exit statuses to be fatal. It is a debugging feature intended for use only during development and should not be used in production code, especially init scripts and other high-availability scripts. Do not be tempted to think of this as &quot;error handling&quot;; it&#039;s not, it&#039;s just a way to find the place you&#039;ve <em>forgotten</em> to put error handling.<br/>
Think of it as akin to <code>use strict</code> in Perl or <code>throws</code> in C++: tough love that makes you write better code. Many guides recommend avoiding it entirely because of the apparently-complex rules for when non-zero statuses cause the script to abort. Conversely, large software projects with experienced coders may recommend or even mandate its use.<br/>
Because it provides no notification of the location of the error, it&#039;s more useful combined with <code>set -x</code> or the <code>DEBUG</code> trap and other Bash debug features, and both flags are normally better set on the command line rather than within the script itself.<br/>
Most of this also applies to the <code>ERR</code> trap, though I&#039;ve seen it used in a few places in shells that lack <code>pipefail</code> or <code>PIPESTATUS</code>. The <code>ERR</code> trap is not POSIX, but <code>set -e</code> is. <code>failglob</code> is another Bash feature that falls into this category (mainly useful for debugging).<br/>
<strong>The <code>set -e</code> feature generates more questions and false bug reports on the Bash mailing list than all other features combined!</strong> Please do not rely on <code>set -e</code> for logic in scripts. If you still refuse to take this advice, make sure you understand <strong>exactly</strong> how it works.

Like <code>set -e</code>, it bypasses control flow and exits immediately from the current shell environment. Like non-zero statuses, unset variables are a normal part of most non-trivial shell scripts. Living with <code>set -u</code> requires hacks like <code>${1+&quot;$1&quot;}</code> for each expansion that might possibly be unset. Only very current shells guarantee that expanding <code>@</code> or <code>*</code> won&#039;t trigger an error when no parameters are set (<a href="http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=155" class="urlextern" title="http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=155" rel="nofollow">http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=155</a>, <a href="http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/bourne_args/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/bourne_args/" rel="nofollow">http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/bourne_args/</a>).

This table lists features that are used only if you have a specific reason to prefer it over another alternative. These have some legitimate uses if you know what you&#039;re doing, such as for those with specific portability requirements, or in order to make use of some subtle behavioral differences. These are frequently (mis)used for no reason. Writing portable scripts that go outside of POSIX features requires knowing how to account for many (often undocumented) differences across many shells. If you do happen to know what you&#039;re doing, don&#039;t be too surprised if you run across someone telling you not to use these.

The idea was for new-style functions to be analogous to regular builtins with their own environment and scope, while POSIX-style functions are more like special builtins. <code>function</code> is supported by almost every ksh-derived shell including Bash and Zsh, but isn&#039;t specified by POSIX. Bash treats all function styles the same, but this is unusual. <code>function</code> has some preferable characteristics in many ksh variants, making it more portable for scripts that use non-POSIX extensions by some measures. If you&#039;re going to use the <code>function</code> keyword, it implies that you&#039;re either targeting Ksh specifically, or that you have detailed knowledge of how to compensate for differences across shells. It should always be used consistently with <code>typeset</code>, but never used with <code>declare</code> or <code>local</code>. Also in ksh93, the braces are not a <a href="/syntax/ccmd/grouping_plain" class="wikilink1" title="syntax:ccmd:grouping_plain"> command group</a>, but a required part of the syntax (unlike Bash and others).

This makes some sense, because future compatibility can&#039;t be guaranteed, and any compatibility at all, requires understanding the non-POSIX features of other shells and their differences. Using <code>declare</code> instead of <code>typeset</code> emphasizes your intention to be &quot;Bash-only&quot;, and definitely breaks everywhere else (except possibly zsh if you&#039;re lucky).

In reality, there are correct ways to use <code>eval</code>, and even cases in which it&#039;s necessary, even in sophisticated shells like Bash and Ksh. <code>eval</code> is unusual in that it is less frequently appropriate in more feature-rich shells than in more minimal shells like Dash, where it is used to compensate for more limitations. If you find yourself needing <code>eval</code> too frequently, it might be a sign that you&#039;re either better off using a different language entirely, or trying to borrow an idiom from some other paradigm that isn&#039;t well suited to the shell language. By the same token, there are some cases in which working too hard to avoid <code>eval</code> ends up adding a lot of complexity and sacrificing all portability.
